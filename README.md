<h1>Healthcare Dashboard Using DOMO</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on creating comprehensive and insightful dashboards for healthcare data visualization using DOMO. By leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can enhance decision-making processes in healthcare management.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Patient Health Monitoring Dashboard:</strong> Visualizes patient health metrics and trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Hospital Management Dashboard:</strong> Provides operational insights into hospital performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient Feedback Analysis Dashboard:</strong> Analyzes patient feedback to identify areas for improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Analytics:</strong> Includes What-If Analysis and alert systems to enhance functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Generation:</strong> Realistic healthcare datasets were created using the Faker library in Python.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Data was filtered, transformed, and validated using DOMOâ€™s ETL tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Development:</strong> Dashboards were designed and customized in DOMO to present the data intuitively.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Iteration:</strong> Regular feedback from supervisors and colleagues was incorporated to refine the dashboards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>DOMO account and basic understanding of DOMO functionalities.</li>
    <li>Python installed on your local machine (for dataset generation).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-dashboard-domo.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:
        <pre><code>cd healthcare-dashboard-domo</code></pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Dataset Generation</h3>
<p>Run the Python script to generate sample healthcare datasets:</p>
<pre><code>python generate_datasets.py</code></pre>

<h3>Data Import and Dashboard Creation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Import the generated datasets into DOMO.</li>
    <li>Follow the provided templates and instructions in the <code>/dashboards</code> directory to create and customize your dashboards in DOMO.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use the Patient Health Monitoring Dashboard to track and analyze patient health metrics.</li>
    <li>Utilize the Hospital Management Dashboard for operational insights and performance tracking.</li>
    <li>Analyze patient feedback using the Patient Feedback Analysis Dashboard to identify areas for service improvement.</li>
    <li>Experiment with What-If Analysis to explore different scenarios and their impacts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The final dashboards provide a comprehensive view of various aspects of healthcare management, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. Screenshots and detailed descriptions of each dashboard are available in the <code>/screenshots</code> directory.</p>
