# Healthcare-Dashboard-Using-DOMO
Project Overview
This project focuses on creating comprehensive and insightful dashboards for healthcare data visualization using DOMO. By leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can enhance decision-making processes in healthcare management.

Features
Patient Health Monitoring Dashboard: Visualizes patient health metrics and trends.
Hospital Management Dashboard: Provides operational insights into hospital performance.
Patient Feedback Analysis Dashboard: Analyzes patient feedback to identify areas for improvement.
Advanced Analytics: Includes What-If Analysis and alert systems to enhance functionality.
Project Structure
Data Generation: Realistic healthcare datasets were created using the Faker library in Python.
Data Cleaning: Data was filtered, transformed, and validated using DOMOâ€™s ETL tools.
Dashboard Development: Dashboards were designed and customized in DOMO to present the data intuitively.
Feedback Iteration: Regular feedback from supervisors and colleagues was incorporated to refine the dashboards.
